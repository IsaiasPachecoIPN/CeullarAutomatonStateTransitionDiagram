# Ceullar Automaton State TransitionDiagram
This program generates the cellular automaton state transition diagrams from all the ECA given some rule and size.

# Introduction

This program generates the cellular automaton state transition diagrams from all the ECA given some rule and size.
Each vertex of the graph represents one of the 2^n states of a size^n elementary cellular automaton and is joined to the vertex representing the stated reached after one step in cellular automaton evolution.
